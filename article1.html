            This is the paper that I wrote for my Literary Criticism mid-exam,
            analysing Hidden Figures using Feminist Criticism theory.
          </p>
          <br />

          <h3>Explanation of Feminist Criticism</h3>
          The feminist movement started as a reaction to gender inequality in
          society. The movement in the 1960s was a renewal of the old feminist
          movement. It was pioneered by the predecessor of this movement — some
          literary icons, such as Mary Wollstonecraft in A Vindication of the
          Rights of Woman (1792), Olive Schreiner in Women and Labour (1911),
          Virginia Woolf in A Room of One’s Own (1929) and Simone de Beauvoir in
          The Second Sex (1949). Not only female authors, but some male authors
          also contributed to feminist writing. There are John Stuart Mill with
          The Subjection of Women (1869) and Friedrich Engels with The Origin of
          the Family (1884). <br /><br /><br />

          However, the feminist movement was influenced by feminist literary
          criticism from the start, with the realisation of women’s portrayal in
          literary work. The major highlight of the feminist criticism in the
          1970s was to expose the mechanisms of patriarchy, the cultural mindset
          of perpetual sexual inequality between men and women. In the 1980s,
          the criticism used other approaches. The first one was more eclectic,
          using the findings and approaches of other kinds of criticism. The
          second one switched its focus from attacking male versions of the
          world to exploring the nature of the female world. The last one was
          about the need for women to rewrite the history of the novel and
          poetry so that the ignored female authors will be given the spotlight
          they deserved.
          <br /><br />To conclude, feminist criticism and the feminist movement
          are the means of society to fight for gender equality in this
          male-dominated world. Feminist criticism should not be seen as an
          off-shoot or a spin-off from feminism which is far from the ultimate
          aims of the movement. But as one of its most practical ways of
          influencing everyday behaviour and mannerism.<br /><br />

          <h3>Movie Synopsis</h3>
          Hidden Figures is a book adaptation movie based on true events. With
          three main characters, namely Katherine G. Johnson (Taraji P. Henson),
          Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spencer), and Mary Jackson (Janelle Monae),
          this movie depicts the struggle of three African-American women
          working at NASA in the 1960s, in which racial issues were happening
          along with the second wave of the feminism movement. They work at the
          West Computing Group with other Black women, before being moved to
          other groups at NASA. Because of their bright minds, they helped NASA
          to fly their rocket during the Space Race between Russia and the
          United States of America.
          <br /><br />
          <h3>Analysis</h3>
          Starting with the title, Hidden Figures, it exactly describes how this
          movie will be. Three Black women provide their knowledge to NASA and
          are not being recognised or appreciated. Those women are the hidden
          figures of NASA. Being overworked, underpaid, and discriminated
          against. Hence, it can be said that all of the inequality comes from
          discrimination and segregation.
          <br /><br />The first gender-based problem shown in this movie is when
          the three of the women, Katherine, Dorothy, and Mary had car trouble
          on the side of the road and a police officer comes to help them. The
          officer doubts that NASA employs women to work there. The problem here
          is that a white male police officer thinks a woman is not capable of
          doing hard work that is mostly done by men. Unconsciously, he assumes
          that all women are weak and unreliable. Through feminism, both females
          and males have the same standard. <br /><br />As the movie goes on,
          more inequality appears. Katherine, who is a mathematical genius, is
          chosen by Dorothy to work for the Space Task Group to handle analytic
          geometry. She then moves to another building for the job. There are
          only two women in the Space Task Group, Katherine and Ruth, the
          secretary. As a woman working in a male-dominated workplace, Katherine
          proves her ability in working on tasks that are mostly done by men.
          With her intelligence, she knows which method would be useful and
          preferable in finding a Frenet frame at the minute: 18:35. Al
          Harrison, the head of Space Task Group, expects Katherine to get her
          work by the end of the day and she fulfils it. However, he told
          Katherine to throw her work away and put it in the trash can.
          Katherine, as the new girl in the department, can only obey him.
          Feeling threatened that she would be dismissed or even fired from her
          job. From that, a male’s superiority of holding a high position in a
          workplace can shut a woman from expressing her opinion.

          <br /><br />In the next scene, Katherine is seen as a loving daughter
          to her mother. Despite her job in a “masculine” place, she still
          appreciates her mother’s support. Also, another side of Katherine
          being a mother is shown in this scene too. She can balance her life as
          a worker, daughter, and mother. To her daughter, she can be an
          assertive yet gentle mother. Thus, Katherine’s character is seen as a
          strong and independent woman. She breaks down the gender roles of
          women that should be good housewives and not expected to be smart or
          educated.

          <br /><br />Charming as she is, Colonel Jim seems to fancy Katherine.
          Later, those two have a little chit chat about Katherine’s work at
          NASA. Being a mathematician at prestigious workplace results in
          Katherine’s huge responsibility. Colonel Jim was surprised that NASA
          trusts women to handle the heavy stuff. That is the misconception that
          has been planted in the human’s mind. Degrading women’s standards by
          not allowing them to do the ‘masculine’ job. Especially Black women.
          They have to work harder to get a decent job, like in NASA. Proven in
          America Becoming: Racial Trends and Their Consequences: Volume II.
          <br /><br />
          <h5>
            In 1960, more than 33 percent of all Black women worked as domestic
            servants (“private house-hold workers”); only 3.2 percent of White
            women held these jobs (statistics cited in this paragraph are from
            the 1960 and 1980 Censuses). In 1960, of all women with 12 years of
            schooling, less than 20 percent of Black women, compared to an
            estimated 54 percent of White women, held jobs as clerical workers;
            and White women were 1.6 times more likely to be employed as
            blue-collar operatives than were Black women.
          </h5>
          <br />
          <h5>(Cecilia A. Conrad, 2001)</h5>
          <br />After all the discrimination and racism Katherine has received,
          she manages to hold an important role in NASA. She is the only one who
          solves the exact-landing-point problem. The only white male who sees
          her quality is John Glenn, the astronaut who will be inside the
          spaceship. With her help, the United States of America succeeded to
          send the first American to the Moon. <br /><br />Next, the scene shows
          Mary and her husband, Levi, arguing about Mary’s dream to be a female
          engineer. Mary, as a Black woman, indeed has a wonderful dream to be
          an engineer. Her husband’s first role is definitely to support her
          dream. However, Levi shows not only his inner sexism, but he is also
          bringing up the race card. Saying that they are Black and are not able
          to fight for freedom. Men are indeed constructed as people who are
          stronger and have more power than women (Febrianti, 2019). In the
          earlier scenes, Mary was needed to help with the testing for the
          Mercury Seven prototype, as requested by Mr Zielinski. Just like
          Katherine, Mary is the only woman in the room, surrounded by men who
          are working at NASA. Zielinski sees Mary’s potential in engineering
          and he encourages her to pursue her career in engineering despite
          being the computer for NASA all of her life. Concerning her
          background, Mary was hesitant at first. As stated during the
          dialogue:<br /><br />
          <h5>
            Zielinski : Let me ask you… if you were a white male, would you wish
            to be an engineer? <br /><br /><br />

            Mary : I wouldn’t have to. I’d already be one.
            <br /><br />
          </h5>
          The discrimination towards women is showing. Women are not trusted to
          be what they want, regardless of their skin colour, women are still
          feeling oppression until now. From Mary’s dialogue, she implicitly
          says that living as a white male would be easier since they have the
          privilege and are treated properly. Discrimination based on race,
          gender and class will not end if there is no strong ideology for the
          existence of Black women (Ikhsano & Jakarudi, 2020). <br /><br />Mary
          Jackson finally decides to go for the Engineer Training Program from
          NASA. However, Vivian, the supervisor, said that Mary is not
          qualified. Even though she has a bachelor’s degree in mathematics and
          physical science. Feeling obliged, she then attends the engineering
          class at Hampton High School. Her struggle does not stop there, she
          has to have permission from the court to join the class because
          Hampton High School is segregated, which means it is a white-only
          school. Mary is determined to be an engineer at NASA, due to her skin
          colour, the facilitation served in Virginia is limited to her. But,
          with her powerful advocacy, the judge finally let her join the course
          but only the night classes. In this scene, Mary shows her persistence
          and determination in fighting segregation, racism, and gender
          inequality. Still, after being permitted, she is the only woman in the
          training, surrounded by white men. But she succeeded to demand her
          rights and prove that women can be engineers too. <br /><br />Mary’s
          struggle paid off by being NASA’s and America’s first female
          African-American aeronautical engineer.<br /><br />
          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          In conclusion, the African-American women in NASA finally got
          recognition for their hard work. After all years of fighting for
          gender equality, however, there are still a lot of people who are
          unaware of the inequality around them. Through Hidden Figures, the
          depiction of racism and gender inequality is crystal clear. The
          representation of people of colour is nowhere to be seen around NASA.
          Those who are in charge of higher positions are white males. Margot
          Lee Shetterly, as the author of the book, did well on portraying the
          figures and working together with the movie director to produce this
          film. <br /><br />Katherine, as the highlight of this movie, has a
          strong determination to fight for her rights as a human, woman, and
          citizen. The separation between black people and white people is a
          product of racism and discrimination that was considered “normal” in
          the 1950s. As a mother of three children, she has to make sure that
          her children will not suffer from the same thing their mother did.
          Being a Black woman in a segregated state of Virginia does not stop
          her from thriving. She proves herself qualified although she is a
          minority. As a result of being educated, she fought inequality and
          racism. It is not only caused by her determination but the support
          from her family also. As a child, she was offered a scholarship and
          her parents positively supported her. As an adult who fought for
          discrimination, she decided to achieve her dream regardless of her sex
          and skin colour. <br /><br />Katherine, Dorothy, and Mary are one of
          the hidden figures of NASA. <br /><br />Even after decades of their
          hard work, racism still still exist in our society.<br /><br />
